### How to Use

Once installed, the custom toolbar will appear automatically with a default layout. All customization is done through the Project Settings window.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, all tools are enabled to showcase the full capabilities of Custom Toolbar. For an optimal experience, especially on smaller screens, customizing the layout is recommended. See the [**Configuring the Toolbar**](#Ô∏è-configuring-the-toolbar) section for details on how to create a personalized and efficient workflow.

<br>

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuring the Toolbar

All customization is done from a two-panel interface in **`Project Settings > Custom Toolbar`**.

<img width="1210" height="735" alt="Settings" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0cfbf822-009e-4000-ab21-1d25b7770b62" />

* **Left Panel:**
    * View all your groups, neatly separated by **Left Side** and **Right Side**.
    * Use the **‚ñ≤/‚ñº buttons** to reorder groups within their sides.
    * Use the **search bar** at the top to quickly find groups or Toolbox shortcuts.
    * Manage your **Toolbox Shortcuts** which can be organized into sub-menus.

* **Right Panel:**
    * When a group is selected, you can rename it, enable/disable it, or move it to the other side of the toolbar.
    * Add, remove, and reorder the elements within that group.
    * When a Toolbox shortcut is selected, use the **Shortcut Editor** to configure its action.

 <br>
 
> [!IMPORTANT]
> After modifying **groups** or their **elements** (adding, removing, or reordering), you must click the **Save and Recompile** button at the bottom of the settings window.
>
> **Why?** The toolbar's layout and its elements are built and injected into the Unity editor only once when scripts are compiled. A recompile is necessary to apply these structural changes.
>
> This step is **not** required when adding or editing **Toolbox shortcuts**. They are loaded dynamically each time you open the menu, so changes are reflected instantly.
 
<br>

  ## üß∞ Built-in Elements

Here is a list of the tools included with the package, ready to be added to your toolbar.

<details>
<summary><strong>Scene Management</strong></summary>
<br>

* **Scene Selection:** A dropdown that lists all scenes from `Assets/Scenes/`, allowing you to open them quickly. It also clearly indicates which scenes are included in the build settings.
* **Start From First Scene:** Starts Play Mode from the first scene listed in your Build Settings, then automatically returns you to your original scene when you exit.
* **Reload Scene:** A button to instantly reload the currently active scene while in Play Mode.
* **Scene Bookmarks:** Save specific camera positions and angles in your scene and navigate to them instantly. A dedicated manager window allows you to add, delete, reorder, and even generate thumbnails for your bookmarks.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Development & Debugging</strong></summary>
<br>

* **Clear PlayerPrefs:** Deletes all data saved in PlayerPrefs with a single click, including a confirmation dialog to prevent accidental data loss.
* **Recompile Scripts:** Manually trigger a script compilation without having to modify a file.
* **Reserialize All Assets:** Forces a reserialization of all assets in your project. A powerful tool for fixing stubborn serialization errors or after a major Unity upgrade.
* **Play Mode Options:** Quickly configure the "Enter Play Mode" settings directly from the toolbar, allowing you to disable domain and scene reloads for lightning-fast iteration times.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Utilities</strong></summary>
<br>

* **Save Project:** A convenient button that saves both the current scene(s) and all modified project assets in one go.
* **Git Status:** If your project is a Git repository, this displays the current branch and an icon indicating if there are uncommitted changes. It also lets you switch between local branches directly from the editor.
* **Screenshot:** A dropdown menu to instantly capture the Game View or Scene View and save it to a `Screenshots` folder. Also includes a shortcut to open this folder directly.
* **FPS Slider:** Controls the application's target frame rate (`Application.targetFrameRate`), perfect for testing performance under different conditions.
* **Timescale Slider:** Controls the game's speed (`Time.timeScale`) during play mode. Invaluable for slow-motion analysis or fast-forwarding through tedious sequences.
* **Toolbox:** Your personal, fully customizable dropdown menu for shortcuts. See the dedicated section below for more details.
* **Favorites:** Opens a powerful window to create and manage custom lists of your most-used assets. Add, remove, and reorder assets with drag-and-drop ease.

</details>

## üõ†Ô∏è The Toolbox: Your Ultimate Shortcut Menu

The Toolbox is one of the most powerful features of Custom Toolbar. It's a special, fully customizable dropdown menu designed to hold all your essential shortcuts. Instead of navigating through complex menus, you can access your most-used windows, assets, tools, and even custom C# methods with a single click.

<br>

<img width="235" height="166" alt="Shortcut_2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb9caa1f-eccf-4c00-8e85-aa1a6ea18508" />

<br>

### The Advanced Shortcut Editor

Configuring shortcuts is made incredibly simple thanks to the **Advanced Shortcut Editor** in the settings window. Instead of forcing you to manually type commands and paths, the editor provides a guided, context-aware interface that adapts to the type of shortcut you want to create.

<br>

<img width="1208" height="735" alt="Shortcut_1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/029be315-2044-4166-adda-3aa954c291a1" />

<br>

1.  **Select an Action Type:** First, choose what you want your shortcut to do. The available actions are:
    * **Window:** Opens any built-in or custom Unity Editor window (e.g., `Project Settings`, `Animation`, `Profiler`). A handy browser is included to help you find the exact menu path without guesswork.
    * **Project Asset:** Instantly opens or highlights any asset in your project (e.g., a specific prefab, a material, a scene file). Simply drag and drop the asset into the object field.
    * **Project Folder:** Pings a specific folder in your Project window, allowing you to navigate to it instantly.
    * **URL:** Opens a web link in your default browser. Perfect for documentation, bug trackers, or team resources.
    * **GameObject:** Selects and pings a specific GameObject in the current scene's hierarchy.
    * **Method:** Calls a static C# method from any script in your project. This is perfect for creating custom tools and powerful one-click macros.

2.  **Use the Interactive Fields:** Based on your choice, the UI adapts to give you the right fields. You'll get an object field for assets and GameObjects, a simple text field for URLs, and the powerful Method Editor for C# methods.

3.  **Unleash the Power of the Method Editor:** The "Method" action type transforms the Toolbox into a potent script runner.
    * Simply drag your C# script file into the "Script File" field.
    * The editor automatically inspects the script and lists all available `public static` methods.
    * Once you select a method, the editor intelligently generates fields for each of its parameters (`int`, `float`, `string`, `bool`, and `enum` types are supported).
    * This removes all the guesswork and potential for typos, allowing you to create complex macro shortcuts with ease.

##  Extending the Toolbar

Creating a new button or tool for the toolbar is straightforward.

1.  Create a new C# script that inherits from `BaseToolbarElement`.
2.  Implement the abstract `Name` property and the `OnDrawInToolbar()` method.
3.  Your new element will automatically appear in the "Add Element" dropdown in the settings window!

**Example:**
```csharp
using CustomToolbar.Editor.ToolbarElements;
using UnityEditor;
using UnityEngine;

// For consistency, name your class starting with "Toolbar".
// The settings UI will automatically remove this prefix for a cleaner display name.
public class ToolbarMyCustomButton : BaseToolbarElement
{
    private GUIContent _buttonContent;

    // The name displayed in the settings window.
    protected override string Name => "My Custom Button";
    
    // The tooltip displayed when hovering over the element.
    protected override string Tooltip => "This button logs a message to the console.";

    // Called once when the toolbar is initialized. Use it for setup.
    public override void OnInit()
    {
        _buttonContent = new GUIContent("Log", this.Tooltip);
    }

    // Called every frame to draw the element in the toolbar.
    public override void OnDrawInToolbar()
    {
        if (GUILayout.Button(_buttonContent, GUILayout.Width(60)))
        {
            Debug.Log("My custom button was clicked!");
        }
    }

    // Called when the editor's play mode state changes.
    public override void OnPlayModeStateChanged(PlayModeStateChange state)
    {
        if (state == PlayModeStateChange.EnteredPlayMode)
        {
            // Example: disable the button in play mode.
            this.Enabled = false; 
        }
        else if (state == PlayModeStateChange.EnteredEditMode)
        {
            this.Enabled = true;
        }
    }
}
```

<br>

## ‚ú® Adding Your New Element

After your script recompiles, your new element is ready to be used!

1.  Navigate to `Edit > Project Settings > Custom Toolbar`.
2.  Select the group where you want to add your new button.
3.  In the right panel, click the **`Add Element`** button. A menu will appear with all available elements.
4.  Select your new element from the list to add it to the group.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Click **`Save and Recompile`** at the bottom of the window. Your new button will now appear on the main toolbar!
